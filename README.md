# NishAnimate

**NishAnimate is a desktop app which produces animated images to help make Nishnaabe-language audio and text understandable.**

## Introduction

NishAnimate will, first, convert user-submitted audio-synchronized Nishnaabe-language text into animatable markup. The markup will then be used by the application to produce a series of animated images which will display in sync with the audio file.

It is expected that this series of moving images, synchronized with the audio, will make the audio understandable to a listener who is also watching the animations.

NishAnimate is built with [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and [Qt 5.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)), and works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows.
