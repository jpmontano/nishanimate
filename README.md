## Introduction
Aanii/Hello -

NishAnimate is a desktop application built with `node-webkit`. NishAnimate will, first, convert audio-synchronized Nishnaabemwin text into animatable markup. The markup will then be used by the application to produce a series of animated images which will display in sync with the audio file.

It is hoped that this series of moving images, synchronized with the audio, will make the audio understandable to a listener who is also watching the animations.

NishAnimate is part of a more general natural-language-agnostic form of the application NLPAnimate, https://github.com/jpmontano/nlpanimate
