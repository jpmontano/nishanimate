Aanii/Hello :)

NishAnimate converts Nishnaabemwin text into animatable mark-up for use in the video-exporting Blender/Python side of this project.

NishAnimate is only one part of a larger, more general natural-language-agnostic form of the app, https://github.com/jpmontano/nlpanimate 

There'll be more details to come. I'm still figuring out how to get around github.

Ahaaw.
